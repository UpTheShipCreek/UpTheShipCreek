- Words tend to make sense in our minds, regardless of, or in spite of, any formal definitions.
This leads to a peculiar form of conceptual argumentation, rooted not in classical logic,
but in the amalgamation of intuitive concepts founded on our intrinsic understanding.

- Okay.

- Consider this phrase: "Hope is that which arises the more you start to lose it."

- Sounds paradoxical; something emerging from its own absence. But it does resonate in a way.

- Indeed. Language isn't math; it lacks precision.

- I get it, language's flexibility. So, what are you getting at?

- The word "hope" in actuality hides behind it two different signified concepts;
the ideas of hope as the expectation of a desired outcome justifiable by concrete evidence and/or reasoning,
and the idea of hope as the expectation of a desired outcome in spite of any evidence that contradicts it.

- So, it's not the hope being lost, but our capacity to justify it.
This clumsy definition is just trying to express the turning point from expectation to hope.

- Yes, essentially.

- So how can this be used as conceptual argumentation?

- Well, I don't know how this specific phrase can be used in that way.
It was just an example to demonstrate how we can make sense of concepts without them following a strict formal structure.
You can take a familiar concept, reframe it, and this process itself will generate new meaning.

- Really? You can't think of an example?

- No.
